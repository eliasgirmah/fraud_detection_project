## Fraud Detection Project### OverviewThis project aims to improve fraud detection for e-commerce and bank transactions using advanced machine learning models. Fraud detection is critical for maintaining financial security, reducing losses, and building trust with customers. This solution will utilize geolocation analysis and transaction patterns to enhance detection.The project follows the entire pipeline: from data analysis and feature engineering to model building, explainability, and deployment using Flask and Docker. A dashboard will provide insights into fraudulent activities.### Project StructurebashCopy codefraud_detection_project/

### Datasets UsedFraud_Data.csvContains e-commerce transaction details aimed at identifying fraud.Key columns:user_id, purchase_value, device_id, class (0 = non-fraud, 1 = fraud)IpAddress_to_Country.csvMaps IP addresses to countries.Used for geolocation analysis.creditcard.csvBank transactions dataset.Features are anonymized with V1 to V28 and the Class target variable (0 = non-fraud, 1 = fraud).### Tasks and WorkflowTask 1: Data Analysis and PreprocessingHandle missing values and clean the datasets.Feature engineering (e.g., transaction frequency, time-based features).Normalize and encode features.Task 2: Model Building and TrainingTrain several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MLP, etc.).Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.Task 3: Model ExplainabilityUse SHAP and LIME to interpret model predictions.Task 4: Model Deployment and API DevelopmentSet up a Flask API to serve fraud predictions.Dockerize the Flask application for scalability.Task 5: Build Dashboard with Flask and DashCreate a dashboard for fraud insights.Visualize fraud trends and geolocation data.### Installation InstructionsClone the repository:bashCopy codegit clone &lt;your-repository-url&gt;
